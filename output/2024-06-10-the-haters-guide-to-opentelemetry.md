I recently presented a talk at Monitorama 2024 titled 'The Hater's Guide to OpenTelemetry'. The slides for that talk are available at [https://austinlparker.github.io/monitorama-2024](https://austinlparker.github.io/monitorama-2024).

The presentation is built in reveal.js -- you can access the speaker notes/transcript by pressing the 's' key. You can also check out the talk recording! It was a lot of fun, thanks for having me, Monitorama!
